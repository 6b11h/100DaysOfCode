# 100DaysOfCode ðŸš€ðŸ’¯

I have been thinking about a way to keep my learning journey like a diary streak, and since I am currently in the Analysis and Systems Development semester at college learning Java, I decided to participate in this challenge. I will be updating this repository with my progress and the code I work on.

I am using Beecrowd problems to train my coding skills and improve my logical thinking in algorithms. I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities through this challenge.

Corrections are welcome! ðŸ˜„

## Day 01

I worked on problem 1047 from Beecrowd. The objective was to create a timer for games with minutes. The code should read the initial and final hours and minutes entered by the user, and then show the duration of the game. The input should consist of 4 integers, and the output should be a message displaying the hours and minutes of the gaming time.
The problem was as follows:
